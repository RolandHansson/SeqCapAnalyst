INTRODUCTION:
This is a SeqCapAnalyst to process .fastq files, producing standard files as well
as statistics useful for singling out target genes. 
Rather than speed, it is optimized for easy moddability.

PREREQUISITES: 
Bash, Python, Java

Stretcher (part of EMBOSS package)

Trimmomatic (included)

vcfutils.pl (included)
---------------------------

INSTALLATION

Make sure prerequisites (above) are installed. 

put SeqCapAnalyst folder in your bin folder, and change directory to bin folder. 

chmod 755 SeqCapAnalyst/SeqCapAnalyst.sh #Add permissions
ln -s SeqCapAnalyst/SeqCapAnalyst.sh #Add to callable programs
bash SeqCapAnalyst/check_dependencies.sh #double-check prerequisites

---------------------------

BASIC RUN

SeqCapAnalyst.sh [target_file] 
Example: SeqCapAnalyst.sh 512022_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq 

NOTE: SeqCapAnalyst is intended for use on Illumina files, 
and thus expects two input files ending in "_R1_001.fastq" and "_R2_001.fastq".
(Only one input file needs to be named; the name of the other will be extrapolated from the first.)

---------------------------

BATCH RUN

SeqCapAnalyst.sh [target_files] 
Example: SeqCapAnalyst.sh *001.fastq 

NOTE: In batch mode, it is not possible to specify folder name. 

---------------------------

PARTIAL RUN

It is possible to delete a file from an output folder, then run SeqCapAnalyst again. 
The program will then recreate only the missing file, unless the "skip" option is set to '0'. 
(The purpose is to make it easier to add and test code for creating new output.) 

---------------------------

OPTIONS: 
-h Display help message
-n Manually set number of cores
-f Specify output folder name. 
-a Specify adapters (path to file)
-b Specify bowtie2 stringency settings 
-s 0 Overwrite existing files in output folder. 
-d 1 On finishing, delete output files except for statistics. (Used for benchmarking) 

----------------------------

CODE ORGANIZATION 

Code is executed module-by-module in linear fashion. 
(When adding more modules, add the code downstream of where prerequisites are made.)

GENERAL STRUCTURE OF MODULES

infile=X
outfile=Y
Unless $outfile exists:
 - make sure $infile exists
 - add settings to LOG
 - use $infile to make $outfile 
 - add execution file to LOG
Report whether module was completed or skipped

---------------------------

CUSTOMIZATION: 

HOW TO CUSTOMIZE CONTAMINANT SEARCH: 
 - Go to the folder "fastq_screen_fastas", 
 - Remove the files you want to replace. (Including index files)  
 - Add fasta files you want to add to the search. (Need to have extension .fasta or .fa to be recognized.) 
 - Run SeqCapAnalyst. Indexing and modification of the Fastq-Screen config file should be performed automatically. 

--------------------------
 
NOTES: 

CORE UTILIZATION: 
In absence of the core number option, ( -n [integer] ), SeqCapAnalyst sets a
default to [nr of cores - 1] with an upper cap of 10. 
Benchmark tests have shown little improvement when using more than 6 cores
(6 for smaller fastq files with about 500MB, 10 for bigger files with about 1GB),
though if reads per exon are made to be more evenly distributed, this will likely
change.
